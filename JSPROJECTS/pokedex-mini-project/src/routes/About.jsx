      AUTHORS DISCLAIMER: I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT POKEMON LORE

      About Lore:


      The Existence of Pokemon has mostly appealed to human society as companions, protectors and partners. Just like our pets but with extra
      features. There have been instances of these creatures being used for malefic purposes, experimentations like with Dr. Fuji's attempts in
      creating the strongest Pokemon. Team Flare tried to convert them into batteries, to fuel an ultimate weapon of their own, to top this entire
      game they play with everyone else.

      But what are we? We do not want to play this game, we do not want these monsters that have for far too long caused humanity a long stagnation
      with their special pets. We do not want to see humanity, which was once a conquering and powerful species stoop so low to a carefree society that
      has forgotten about survival against destruction. We want NOTHING FROM THESE POKEMON BUT THEIR DEATHS.

      Like kids who cling to their objects of lesser value in truth, like deranged fools who wish to still be on crutches when they can walk without them,
      these beings no longer serve their purpose as glorified fighting dogs but as specialized assets to bring humanity to a new age, a new way of thinking and a
      new society.

      There are members within our ranks that see beyond this game, this enslavement of these beasts that's promoted, this world that dares use these creatures
      as a means of keeping the world pacified until the cyclones of time will punish them hard that their so-called companions will not even save them.

      We are masters of that cyclone, masters that rule beyond hindrances like superstition and instinct, masters that will show the world a real beautiful world
      which exists without this world's game.
      
      Beware the rust of humanity's iron will to conquer challenges, beware the loss of mankind's will to thrive like water losing its purity
      from stagnation. You can either choose to break free and be one with the cyclone of change or be destroyed by it by letting
      time sap away the vigor of mankind to see opportunities outside its deceptive comfort zone.
